### Description
In this project, we will use the min-cut formulation to do image segmentation. 
Image segmentation is, in general, a very hard problem but is very useful in a variety of applications including medical diagnosis, autonomous driving and face recognition. 
Several variants of the problem exist (like hierarchical image segmentation and image labeling). 
Though several competing methods have been proposed, graph-partitioning methods play a central role and have been found to be very successful. 
The min-cut is essentially a graph partitioning problem that seeks to cut a graph/network into disjoint pieces in such a way that it minimizes an objective.
