## Project on Optimization using Integer Programming

Team members: Akankshi Mody, Satya Naren Pachigolla, Jayant Raisinghani

### Description
In this project, we will create an Index fund with 25 stocks to track the NASDAQ-100 index. We will do this in multiple steps. First, we will formulate an integer program that picks exactly q out of n stocks for our portfolio. This integer program will take as input a ‘similarity matrix,’ which we will call rho. The individual elements of this matrix represent: rho(ij) = similarity between stock i and stock j
An example of this is the correlation between the returns of stocks i and j. But one could choose other
similarity metrics rho(ij). Next, we will construct a portfolio by selecting appropriate weights for the 25 stocks
and finally evaluate how well our index fund does as compared to the NASDAQ-100 index.
